mdns-repeater
==============
mdns-repeater is a Multicast DNS repeater for Linux. Multicast DNS uses the 
224.0.0.251 (IPv4) and ff02::fb (IPv6) addresses, which are "administratively
scoped" and do not leave the subnet.

This program re-broadcast mDNS packets from one interface to other interfaces.
It was written primarily to be run on my Linksys WRT54G which runs dd-wrt,
since my wireless network is on a different subnet from my wired network and 
I would like my zeroconf devices to work properly across the two subnets.

Since the mDNS protocol sends the A records in the packet itself, the
repeater does not need to forge the source address. Instead, the source 
address is of the interface that repeats the packet.

For IPv6, some devices send AAAA records containing a link-local address.
The repeater does currently not change such records, meaning that hosts
might be advertised with unreachable addresses.


USAGE
-----
mdns-repeater only requires the interface names and it will do the rest.
For example, the dd-wrt standard installation defines br0 for the wireless 
interface and vlan1 as the WAN interface, I would use:

    mdns-repeater br0 vlan1

You can also specify the -f flag for debugging, which prints packets as they 
are received.

You are free to modify the code to repeat whatever traffic you require, as
long as you abide by the software license.
